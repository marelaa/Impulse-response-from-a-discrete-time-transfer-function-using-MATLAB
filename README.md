# Impulse-response-from-a-discrete-time-transfer-function-using-MATLAB
This MATLAB project takes the transfer function of a physical system, converts it into the discrete-time transfer function, and plots the system's impulse response based on the recurrence equation and The PI controller
#features
- Computes the discrete-time transfer function from the system's transfer function
- Includes the effect of a PI controller
- Plots the impulse response graphically
# How to use
- Open the MATLAB script
- Replace the input coefficients (numerator and denominator)with your own system values
- Adjust The PI controller parameters
- Run the script
# Note
The program ssumes a causal system
# files
- program.m Matlab code
- plot.png Example of the impulse response plot generated by the program
